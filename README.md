# flutterflowtest

A new FlutterFlow project.

I've tested if I can take the code of a FlutterFlow preview (page by page) and get it to run.

## Notes

- I can be done but ...
- Not ideal, for a commercial project much better to use their subscription offer
- Have to do null safety manually
- Got the `/lib/flutter_flow` code from other recent github flutterflow projects and manually converted it to be null safe
